<h1>Usage Of DPE attributes by API manager</h1>
<h2>When API manager is configured as a DIP client</h2>
<h3>User bits</h3>
<p>The first 2 user bits are used to hold the quality of the data being written
  into the DPE. OPC quality mappings used as basis for this policy.</p>
<table width="100%" border="1">
  <tr>
    <td>DIP Quality</td>
    <td>PVSS users bits</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>DIP_QUALITY_UNINITIALIZED (-1)</td>
    <td>0 decimal (00 binary) = bad</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>DIP_QUALITY_BAD (0)</td>
    <td>0 decimal (00 binary) = bad</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>DIP_QUALITY_GOOD (1)</td>
    <td>3 decimal (11 binary) = good</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>DIP_QUALITY_UNCERTAIN (2)</td>
    <td>1 decimal (01 binary) = uncertain</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><em><strong>Note</strong> the reasonForQuality string (which provides supplementary information
  on the quality when it is not good) is not used by the API manager</em>.</p>
<h3>Use of invalid flag</h3>
  The DPE invalid flag is used to indicate either either a problem in the API 
manager or the DIP publication does not exist.<ol>
  <li> The API manager can not find a converter to convert from the DIP to PVSS
  type.
  <li> The publication the DPE is associated with is not available.
  <li> If a type conversion has failed (i.e. The data type of the publication has
  changed).
  </ol>
<p>If the invalid flag is set then the value and user bits are NOT to be 
trusted.</p>
<h3>Timestamp</h3>
  The timestamp supplied with the received DIP data is used as the timestamp
  for the DPE value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Client Scenarios</h3>
<p>Below are a list of scenarios that you may expect to encounter in a running 
system and an indication of how the API manager will behave in that scenario.</p>
<ol>
	<li>API manager subscribes to publication that does not exist. <b>What to 
	expect:-</b> Invalid bit will be set to true (time stamp will be 0), value &amp; 
	user bits will be left unchanged.</li>
	<li>Publication is created (but not published data) AFTER the API manager 
	subscribes.&nbsp; <b>What to expect:-</b> Invalid bit will be set to false, 
	user bits will be set to bad (time stamp will be 0) &amp; value will be left 
	unchanged.</li>
	<li>Publication publishes data AFTER API manager subscribes. <b>What to 
	expect:-</b> Invalid bit will be set to false, value &amp; timestamp set from 
	DIP&nbsp; value/timestamp. User bits will be&nbsp; set from the DIP quality 
	according to the mapping described above.</li>
	<li>API manager subscribes to publication that exists but has not sent data.
	<b>What to expect:-</b> Scenario 1) followed be 2)</li>
	<li>API manager subscribes to publication that exists and has sent data. <b>
	What to expect:-</b> Scenario 1) followed be 2), then 3)</li>
	<li>API manager subscribes to publication that disappears. <b>What to 
	expect:-</b> Invalid bit will be set to true (time stamp set to current 
	time), value &amp; user bits will be left unchanged.</li>
	<li>API manager subscribes to publication that changes its data type.&nbsp;
	<b>What to expect:-</b> As scenario 6).</li>
</ol>

<h2>When API manager is configured as a DIP Publisher</h2>
<h3>Use of invalid flag</h3>
  If the invalid flag is set for any DPE used to make up the DIP publication
    then the quality of that publication is set to bad. The reason for quality
    string indicates how many DPE's for that publication have their invalid
    bit set.</p>
  <h3>Timestamp</h3>
  Of all DPE's that make of the publication, the one with the most recent
  timestamp is the one which provides the time stamp for the data sent via the
  DIP publication.<br>
