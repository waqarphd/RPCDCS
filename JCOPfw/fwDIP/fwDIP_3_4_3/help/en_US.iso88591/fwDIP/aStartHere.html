<h1 class="style4">The DIP API MANAGER </h1>
<p>The DIP API manager can be configured as a DIP client and/or DIP server. </p>
<p>As a DIP client, the API manager will allow DIP publications (where the publication
  is of a primitive type) or a field within a publication (where the Publication
  is of a structured type) to provide data to PVSS DPE's. One Publication/Field
  may provide data for many DPE's. But one DPE may only obtain its data from
  one publication/field.</p>
<p>As a DIP Publisher, the API manager will allow one or more DPE's to be publisher
  via DIP as primitive or structured publications. One DPE may provide data for
  many Publications, and one publication may obtain data from many (unique) DPE's.</p>
<p>JCOP FW pannels exist to assist the user in configuring the DIP API manager
  in these client/publisher configurations.</p>

<p class="style1">Release Notes </p>
<p class="style3">New features of fwDIP 3.4.3</p>
<p><strong>Optionally disable DPE locking</strong></p>
<p>As of fwDIP 3.4.2, the API manager would lock any PVSS DPE mapped to a DIP 
subscription, in order to avoid DPE becoming invalid because of conflicting 
timestamps.</p>
<p>It is now possible to disable the locking behaviour with the following API 
manager flag</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>E.g. : -no_dpe_locking</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>WARNING </strong>- disabling DPE locking <strong>is not supported in 
a production environment</strong>. Please refer to bug
<a href="https://icecontrols.cern.ch/jira/browse/DIP-44">DIP-44</a> for more 
details about the possible effects.</p>
<p class="style3">New features of fwDIP 3.4.2</p>
<p><strong>Specifying the usage of correction values for outdated DIP timestamps</strong></p>
<p>As of fwDIP 3.4.2, when a DIP data packets arrives with a timestamp which is anterior to the last DPE update, fwDIP will force the DPE timestamp to current time, and optionally publish a correction value (provided archiving is active for the corresponding DPE).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>E.g. : -publish_correction_values</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For  convenience, there is a trace in the PVSS log when command line argument is  used:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> E.g.: PVSS00dip The -publish_correction_values flag was specified, ....</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Specifying whether invalid ranges should invalidate DIP publications</strong></p>
<p>As of fwDIP 3.4.1, DPE flagged with invalid ranges would cause the corresponding DIP publication to receive the quality <b>BAD</b>. As of fwDIP 3.4.2, this behaviour is now optional, and can be deactivated (to revert to pre-3.4.1 behaviour).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>E.g. : -ignore_invalid_ranges</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For  convenience, there is a trace in the PVSS log when command line argument is  used:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> E.g.: PVSS00dip The -ignore_invalid_ranges flag was specified, we will not consider PVSS range invalidity to mark a DIP publication with BAD quality. ....</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="style3">New features of fwDIP 3.2.0</p>
<p><strong>Specifying the DNS</strong></p>
<p>You could specify a specific DNS to the DIP API Manager  using the -dns command line argument,&nbsp;  followed by the name(s) of the DNS(s).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>E.g. : -dns pcitco161</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that standard DNS lists are supported as well:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>E.g. : -dns pcitco161,pcitco151,pcitco110</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For  convenience, there is a trace in the PVSS log when command line argument is  used:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> E.g.: PVSS00dip [...], INFO, [...] Connecting to the DNS  specified on the command line: pcitco161,pcitco122</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>New delimiter in DIP publication configuration</strong></p>
<p>In previous versions of fwDIP, a special character (0x1a) was used as a delimeter in the DIP publication information stored in the PVSS internal data points. This caused problems when exporting this information using the PVSS ASCII manager. As of fwDIP 3.2.0, a new delimeter is supported. This is the exclamation mark, !.</p>
<p>When you install fwDIP 3.2.0 all your configuration will be moved to use this new delimeter. If you previously used ! in your DIP publications names (or tag names) you will have to use the fwDIP panel to correct this. It is no longer possible to publish DIP items (or tags) from PVSS that contain the ! character. </p>
