	<html:p>
	This is a reference panel to be used (embedded) in the user's panels. It indicates the name of the user
	that is currently logged-in (to the instance of the UI), and allows to perform common operations, such
	as login of another user, logout, lookup of user with certain privilege, or even system administration.
	</html:p>
	<html:p>
	This panel is embedded, for instance, in the <otherPanel name="fwAccessControl_Toolbar" text="Access Control Toolbar"/> panel,
	used frequently by system administrators, therefore it will further be discussed in context of the Toolbar panel.
	</html:p>
	<html:p>
	The toolbar panel (constituted by the fwAccessControl_CurrentUser.pnl embedded as a reference panel) is presented in
	Figure 1.
	<picture id="1" url='fwAccessControl_Toolbar1.png' caption='The Access Control Toolbar panel'/>
	
	The panel consisits of the framed line of text indicating the login name of the user currently logged in
	("operator" in Figure 1),
	and the <button img="login.png"/> button, clicking on which brings up the <otherPanel name="login_panel" text="login"/>
	panel. The indicated user name may also be "NO USER", which indicates that nobody is logged in.
	<html:br/> 
	The Toolbar panel contains also the standard framework help button (shown in Figure 1);
	the reference panel fwAccessControl_CurrentUser.pnl contains neither the help button, nor the "JCOP Framework Access Control"
	title.
	</html:p>
	<html:p>
	Right-clicking on the <button img="login.png"/> button, or on the user name, brings up the context menu, presented in Figure 2.

	The description of the commands in the context menu are given in the "Instructions" section below.
	</html:p>

	    The <button name="Tools >"/> submenu contains the entries presented in Figure 3.

	    <picture id="4" url='fwAccessControl_Toolbar4.png' caption='"Administration" sub-menu of the context menu' />

	<html:p>
	When access control is disabled (see the <otherPanel name="fwAccessControl_Setup" text="Setup"/> panel), the panel
	is surrounded by a yellow frame, as shown in Figure 5.
	<picture id="5" url='fwAccessControl_Toolbar5.png' caption='The panel indicates that access control is disabled'/>
	In the disabled mode of operation, all users are granted all access right (i.e. all restrictions 
	in the panels are deactivated).
