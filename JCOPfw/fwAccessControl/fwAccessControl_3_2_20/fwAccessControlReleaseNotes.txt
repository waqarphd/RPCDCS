8.November.2004, ver. 2.3.0
---------------------------
WARNING:
Version 2.3.0 is only available from CVS branch calles AccessControl-2_3_0 now.

This is the first release of the functional Access Control component.
The panels have been implemented to manage Domains, Users and Groups.
The most important panel from this group is 
    fwAccessControl_systemControl.pnl
On needs to log in to this panel to be able to configure the access control.
There are two user accounts installed automatically: SysAdmin and Administrator.
Both of them have empty passwords. One can controll all the aspects of 
Access Control tool using SysAdmin account. The Administrator account is
limited to managing users and groups (i.e. domains may not be added/removed).

The library is distributed in the encoded form for security reasons. The
documentation for publicly-available API will be released shortly,
and so will be the examples. One may have a look how access control is
implemented e.g. in fwAccessControl_systemControl.pnl panel.
