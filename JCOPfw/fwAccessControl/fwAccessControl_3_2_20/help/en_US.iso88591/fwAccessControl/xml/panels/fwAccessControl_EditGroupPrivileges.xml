    <description>    
    <html:p>
	This panel allows to define the privileges granted to which a group. The panel is presented in Figure 1.    
    <picture id="1" url='fwAccessControl_EditGroupPrivileges1.png' caption="Edit group's access rights panel"/>


    The central part of the panel contains two lists: the access right list (made of domain selector
    and table of privilege names) on the left, and the list
    of the access rights that are going to be granted to a group, on the right. <html:br/>
    Note that the access rights, which are already in the right list are "greyed out"
    in the left list, and cannot be selected.
    </html:p>
    
    <html:p>
    To make the navigation in the right list easier, it is possible to filter on the name of the
    domain. One needs to unselect the <html:em>Show all granted privileges</html:em> box; then,
    the right list will only display the privileges in the domain that is selected for the left list.
    Such situation is presented in Figure 2:
    <picture id="1" url='fwAccessControl_EditGroupPrivileges2.png' 
	caption="Edit group's access rights panel displaying selected privileges only"/>
    In this Figure, the <html:em>Show all granted privileges</html:em> option is deactivated
    and the domain selected in the left list is <html:code>MyDCS/Tracker/Pixel</html:code>;
    note that the title frame of the right has changed to 
    <html:em>Granted privileges in MyDCS/Tracker/Pixel</html:em>, and the list indicates only
    the privileges in this domain.
