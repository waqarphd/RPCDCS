Release Notes For FwFSM v9r0:

Linked with:
    - DIM v12r1
    - SMI++ v13r0
    - PVSS 2.12.1 (PVSS 2.12 also available in the Zip)

Bug Fixes / Improvements for V9r0:
    - At run time the user can now decide which devices/objects are visible
      and/or user controllable in the domain operation's panel. This can be
      done by right clicking in a domain and then using the "parametrization" 
      button in the domain tab).
    - Two new calls have been created which can be used inside the device 
      type scripts:
	- fwDU_getAlarmLimits(string device, string elem, dyn_float &limits)
	  Returns the list of defined alert limits for this data point element.      
	  Can be used inside the device type scripts (XXX_valueChanged())to make 
	  the calculation of a new state depend on the alarm limits set by the 
	  alert_hdl config.
	  (replaces fwFsm_getDeviceAlarmLimits from the previous version)
	- fwDU_startTimeout(int secs, string device, string state[, string desired_state])
	  Starts a timeout for the device, if the device doesn't change state
          [or doesn't change to a specific state] whithin the specified time 
	  it is sent to state <state>.
	  To be used inside the device type scripts (XXX_doCommand() or 
	  XXX_valueChanged()) to start a timeout at the time a command is executed
	  or a new state is reached.
        - Other minor calls are also available and documented in the fwDU library.

Bug Fixes / Improvements for V8r0:
    - Improoved the handling of domains running on distributed systems
      (device and object types can be imported from other systems)
    - PVSS00smi now kills all smiSMs and then exits when the project is 
      stopped
    - Specific device types can now be created from the generic types:
      _FwAi, _FwAo, _FwDi, _FwDo and _FwNode
    - The new call:
      fwFsm_getDeviceAlarmLimits(string device, string elem, dyn_float &limits)
      can be used inside the device type scripts to make the calculation of 
      a new state depend on the alarm limits set by the alert_hdl config 

Bug Fixes / Improvements for V7r1:
    - Fixed a bug in the AlarmScreen/Alarm button for 2.12.1
    - Made all panels larger for big object/domain names

Bug Fixes / Improvements for V7r0:
    - Improoved the starting/stopping of domains and domain trees
      (including the correct stopping of smiSM and PVSS00smi processes)
