<h1>Controlling  data Transmission/Atomicity</h1>
<p>This page describes how to control the publication of DPE values through the
  DIP API manager.</p>
The first thing to understand is that no data from DPE's will be published 
<ol>
 <li>Until the API manager has received at least one value for each of the
    DPE's making up the publication. Until this time the data quality is set to bad and
  the reason for quality string indicates how many DPE's have not yet supplied
  initial values.
  <li>When any of the DPE's making up the publication have their invalid
bit set (see above).
</ol>
The time at which the data from DPE's making up a publication are sent
  is partially determined by the buffer time (mSec) which is provided in the
  client configuration panels of the JCOP framework. When
<ul>
  <li> Buffer time = 0. All DPE's making up a Publication are expected to
  be updated within PVSS atomically. Thus the DPE values received by the API
  manager will be published immediately (assuming one of the 2 conditions above
  do NOT hold).
  <li> Buffer time > 0. The first DPE making up a publication triggers a timer.
  All changes to DPE values making the Publication are recorded, when the timer
  expires (BufferTime is reached) the most recent value of each DPE making up
  the publication is published (again, assuming one of the 2 conditions above
  do NOT hold).
</ul>
This policy is motivated by the philosophy of DIP which requires that all
  fields making up a DIP complex publication are consistent. It is recognized
  that DPEs making up a publication may be updated from different (most likely
  unsynchronized) sources and at different rates, so the buffer time mechanism
  is used to provide a means for 'ensuring' all updates to DPE's
  are received before the publication is made. Whilst this mechanism is
  far from perfect, it is relatively simple and given the indeterminate date
  of the DPE updates, the best we can currently think of (any better suggestions
  will be greeted with interest).<br>
