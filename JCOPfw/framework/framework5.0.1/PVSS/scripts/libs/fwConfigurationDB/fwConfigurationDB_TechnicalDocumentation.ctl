/** @brief  Input/Output table for the PL/SQL API
 *
 * @ingroup PLSQLAPI
 *
 * CDB_API_PARAMS is a global temporary table used to pass the data from/to
 * the PL/SQL functions contained in the package  @ref PLSQLAPI .
 *
 * The table is used to pass the data which has a form of list of records, such
 * as the list of device names, or a list of settings for a recipe, where
 * device element is specified in one column, and the corresponding setting in another.
 *
 * The fields in the table have no a`priori associated meaning, that is why their names
 * are generic. Each function expects its input data to be present in certain columns,
 * and delivers the output into certain columns - the actual assignment (or: meaning)
 * for each column is provided in the description of each procedure.
 *
 * Being a temporary table, CDB_API_PARAMS does not occupy disk space: it is created in
 * the memory of the database server, and the data contained in it persist
 * only within a session. That also means that separate database sessions 
 * (connected to the same database schema) will refer to their private
 * instances of CDB_API_PARAMS, and will not see/alter the data in the
 * instances belonging to other sessions.
 *
 * The CDB_API_PARAMS table preserves it contents when a commit operation
 * is performed. This is to be able to feed the results returned by one
 * PL/SQL procedure as an input to another. A user should
 * remember to truncate this table before calling a PL/SQL procedure,
 * if he wants to assure the consistency of the data passed into the
 * procedure, using the SQL statement:
 * @code
 *	DELETE FROM CDB_API_PARAMS;
 * @endcode
 * For safety, some data-integrity checking mechanisms are built into
 * a majority of functions in the package; calling a procedure without
 * cleaning up this I/O table will end up in an error.
