JCOP FRAMEWORK version 2.3.X
============================

*INSTALATION of the PVSS part of the Framework:

This version of the Framework is not compatible
with previous versions 1.X.X. If you have a running
project that needs to be upgraded, contact us through
the normal support channel.

You will need to install the Framework for every PVSS 
project where you want to run the Framework. Follow 
these steps:

1. Create a new project or go to an existing one.

2. Download the Component Installation Tool zip file
   (fwInstallation2.1.X.zip)

3. Copy the zip file to your project root directory and
   unzip it there. The files in the zip have to go to
   the appropriate directories in the project (with Winzip
   you need to select the option 'Use folder names', other
   zip tools may require other options to make sure each file
   goes in the right folder)

4. Download the Framework 2.3.X release zip file (framework2.3.X.zip),
   and unzip it somewhere in your hard disk (e.g. under C:\temp\).
   
   This will create a folder called framework2.3.X\  
   (e.g. C:\temp\framework2.3.X\)

5. Start your project.

6. Run the Component Installation Main panel.

   Open in run mode the panel "fwInstallation.pnl"
   located in the directory panels/fwInstallation/ of your
   project.

7. Follow the instructions of the Component Installation

   -If it is the first time you open the Installation panel, it 
   will ask you for a directory where to install the Framework
   (e.g. c:\Software\Framework\, in principle there has to be a
   different installation directory for each different PVSS project
   where you are using the Framework).
   It is recommended to use an empty folder in your system. 
   Be aware that in Windows this folder can be a subdirectory 
   of your project directory, but in Linux it cannot be.
   
   -For the field "Look for new components in:" select the PVSS\
   subdirectory below the Framework unzipped distribution of step 4.
   (e.g. C:\temp\framework2.3.X\PVSS\)

8. Install the components you require for your system.

9. Follow the instruction given by the Installation Tool

10. Now you are ready to use the Framework.
