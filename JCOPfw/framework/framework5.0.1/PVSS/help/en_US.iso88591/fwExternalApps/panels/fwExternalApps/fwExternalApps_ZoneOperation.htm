<p>
The LACS infrastructure consists of "Zones".  A "Zone" consists of 'Access-Points', 'Key-Holders' and 'Sectors'.
There is no obvious relation between on one hand 'Sectors' and the other hand 'Access-Points' and 'Key-Holders'.
An 'Access-Point' can be in the states: Invalid, General, Restricted or Closed.
A 'Key-Holder' can be in the states: 
Fault, Invalid, Moving, Safe, SaveLocked, Unsafe, UnsafeLocked.
