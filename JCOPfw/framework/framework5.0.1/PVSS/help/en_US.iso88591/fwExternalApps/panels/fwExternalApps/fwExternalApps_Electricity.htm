</center>

<p>
The Summary-Status of the electrical switchboards are calculated in the following way. 
The logic will be based on the digital information "Relais de Pr&eacute;sence Tension" when available, 
or from the analogue measurements made at the switchboard bus bar level when available, 
or calculated from information available only at the feeder level (case of the 
TDM type distribution switchboards used to supply the Electronics Racks).
The overall meaning of the Summary-States are the following:
<ul>
<li>0 = not calculated
<li>1 = not energized
<li>2 = energized
<li>3 = reserved
</ul>

The Synoptics of the electricity infrastructure are available in the same directory 
as where the subscription/publication files are for importation.
The example below corresponds to the LHCb experiment's electrical synoptics:
"data/fwExternalApps/Electricity/LHCb_Synoptic_Proposal_V4.pdf".
