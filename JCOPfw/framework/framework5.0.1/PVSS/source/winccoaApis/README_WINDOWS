
In order to Build the DIM and/or SMI ApiManager:
	WCCOAdim and/or WCCOAsmi

The following environment variables have to be set up:

  API_ROOT Set to the PVSS API installation directory
  DIMDIR   Set to the DIM installation directory
  SMIDIR   Set to the SMI++ installation directory (for SMI only)

Then go to the "Visual" directory and open 
	ApiMan<version>.sln

Where <version> is the PVSS version, it can be:
3.11

Then click on the appropriate "Build" commands

Finally copy the executables to the relevant project's bin directory:
