In order to Build the DIM and/or SMI ApiManager:
	WCCOAdim and/or WCCOAsmi

The following environment variables have to be set up:

  API_ROOT Set to the PVSS API installation directory
  PLATFORM linux
  DIMDIR   Set to the DIM installation directory
  SMIDIR   Set to the SMI++ installation directory (for SMI only)

Then do: 
	gmake VERSION="<version>" all	! to make everything
	or 
	gmake VERSION="<version>" dim	! to make only PVSS00dim

Where <version> is the PVSS version, it can be:
3.11

Finally copy the executables to the relevant project's bin directory:
	linux/WCCOAdim<version>
	linux/WCCOAsmi<version>

NOTE:
The current executables for the latest PVSS versions are already in the "linux" directory
