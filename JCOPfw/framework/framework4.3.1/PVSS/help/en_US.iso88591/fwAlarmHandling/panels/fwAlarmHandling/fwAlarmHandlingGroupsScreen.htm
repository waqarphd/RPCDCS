      <p>This panel allows you to view the alarms in your system, and to have a summarized view of alarms, grouped following your criteria.</p>

          Compared to <a href = "fwAlarmHandlingScreen.htm">fwAlarmHandlingScreen.pnl</a>, this panel features the same alarm list. The alarm filtering is still available, using the usual button &quot;Modify Filter&quot;.
          Historical alarms filter is also available, inside the box &quot;Mode&quot;.</p>
		  The extra feature of this panel is mainly the Grouping: the alarms shown on the list are scanned and then a statistic is made:
        <ul>
          <li>How many alarms are visible</li>
          <li>How many of them have not been acknowledged</li>
          <li>How many of them are new</li>
          <li>Time of the last alarm</li>
        </ul>
		  The statistic is based on a criteria as specified by a user (i.e. take into account only alarms coming from &quot;system1&quot; and &quot;system2&quot;, and having dp name matching the pattern &quot;dp*&quot;...). This criteria is saved under a Group. You can create as many groups as you wish. Each group will appear as a separate box.</p>
        <p><strong>Groups</strong></p>
        <p>To create a group, click on the button &quot;Groups Setup&quot;. Please refer to <a href="fwAlarmHandlingGroupsConfiguration.htm">fwAlarmHandlingGroupsConfiguration</a>.</p>
        <p>When a new alert displayed in the alarm list matches the criteria of a group, the group will increment the &quot;New&quot; counter. The &quot;Unack&quot; counter will be incremented only if the alarm is acknowledgeable and not yet acknowledged. The &quot;New&quot; counter will be incremented; it will be decremented only after the operator opened the alarm help (right-click on the alarm line, click on &quot;Alarm Help&quot;).</p>
		<p>The alarm matching is done in sequence: if it does not match the first group criteria, the second group criteria is then analysed, and so on. An alarm that matches a group will be ignored by all the following groups.</p>
		<p>The colour of the group is inherited from the highest priority alarm. Among alarms of the same priority, the colour of the unacknowledged alarm is taken.</p>
        <p><strong>New alarms</strong></p>
        <p>Every time a new alarm appears, a bell is ringed (option - see <a href="fwAlarmHandlingGroupsConfiguration.htm">fwAlarmHandlingGroupsConfiguration</a> for more info).</p>
        <p>An alarm appearing on the alarms list is marked as New if the operator has never opened its help (right-click on the alarm line, click on &quot;Alarm Help&quot;).</p>
