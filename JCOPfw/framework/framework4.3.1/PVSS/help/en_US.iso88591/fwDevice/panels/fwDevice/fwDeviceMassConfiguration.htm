      </strong></td>
      <td colspan="2"> This panel is used to change the settings of a
group of devices in one go. The group can be selected according to
different criteria: type, name, alias and comment. All the criteria
have to be met (logical AND). If a device is passed as parameter, then
the search will only apply from that device down the hierarchy
(hardware or logical), including itself.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign="top">
      <td bgcolor="#00cc00"><strong>Instructions</strong></td>
      <td colspan="2">These steps have to be followed:<br>
      <ol>
        <li>Enter the search criteria in the fields enclosed in the
'Search' frame. If a device was passed to the panel, the search will be
restricted to the hierarchy below that device, including it. In the <a
 href="#Figure_1">screenshot</a> below, the board
dist_1:CAEN/caenitco02/board00 was passed as parameter, so it would not
be possible to search above it (e.g. setting the field 'Device DP
name'&nbsp; to dist_1:CAEN/caenitco02* would give an error).</li>
        <li>After pressing the 'Search' button, the table displays the
devices that met the specified criteria. Initially all the listed
devices are included. It is possible to include/exclude devices by
clicking in the 'Include' column.<br>
        </li>
        <li>You can now configure with the default settings the
hardware connection, the alarms, the archiving or the dp functions for
the devices
selected in the previous steps.</li>
        <li>If all the devices in the table are of the same type, then
it is also possible to set individual elements for all of them in the
'Element settings' frame. Choose an element in the 'Elements' combox
and then select the button corresponding to the setting you want to
change. A panel will pop up to enter the necessary data. By default
you can only work with elements declared in the device definition. If
you want to work with all the elements in the device just untick the
'Use device definition' checkbox. <br>

      <ul>
        <li>It is only possible to select Framework device
types. A datapoint type has to be registered as Device type to appear
in the list.</li>
        <li>All the buttons in 'Element settings' frame except the 'Set
Address' button will work even if the correspondent config doesn't
exist. In that case, the config will be created. For the address, it is
only possible to modify existing addresses.</li>
