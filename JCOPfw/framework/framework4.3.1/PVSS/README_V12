Linked with:
    - DIM v13r9
Available for:
    - PVSS 2.12, 2.12.1 and 3.0 Candidate Release

Bug Fixes / Improvements:
    - Commands going to a DIM server very fast would sometimes get lost or
      out of order - fixed. (the user still has to use dpSetWait()).
    - Introduced a new option when Subscribing to DIM Services: The user
      can specify if he/she wants to receive an update immediately after
      connection or only when the server does the next updateService().
      This is available from the fwDim.pnl panel or by using the fwDim script
      library
    NOTE: the following fwDim library calls have changed:
	 fwDim_subscribeService
	 fwDim_subscribeServices
	 fwDim_getSubscribedServices
      - the first two are backward compatible but the last one is not!

Linked with:
    - DIM v13r4
Available for:
    - PVSS 2.12, 2.12.1 and 3.0 Candidate Release

Bug Fixes / Improvements:
    - Improved the installation procedure: Now several PVSS versions are
      available. The fwDimInstall script will take care of choosing the 
      right one.
      So PVSS projects of different versions can be used with the same 
      FwDIM directory.
