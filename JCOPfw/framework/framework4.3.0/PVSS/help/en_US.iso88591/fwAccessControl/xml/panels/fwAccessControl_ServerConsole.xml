    <picture id="1" url='fwAccessControl_ServerConsole.png' caption='The Server Console panel'/>
    </html:p>
    <html:p>The panel consists of the following elements:
	<html:ul>
	    <html:li> The indicator of the name of the machine on which this panel is running 
		(<html:em>"ACServer:"</html:em> in Figure 1)</html:li>
	    <html:li> The indicator of the connection status (green "OK" in Figure 1)</html:li>
	    <html:li> The table containing the list of all systems in the distributed system.
		The first column indicates system number, the second: system name, the third
		shows the current setting of the <html:em>AC Server</html:em> on that system,
		and the last: indicates whether the system is currently being managed by the server.
	    </html:li>
	</html:ul>
	Right-clicking on the table brings up a context menu. If clicked on the system
	machine corresponding to the server itself, the context menu will be such as the one
	in Figure 2:
	<picture id="2" url='fwAccessControl_ServerConsole_ctxmenuServer.png' caption='Context menu for the server'/>
	Otherwise, for client machines, the menu presented in Figure 3 will pop up; the top line indicates that
	the line for which the menu was displayed corresponds to the AC Server.
	<picture id="3" url='fwAccessControl_ServerConsole_ctxmenuClient.png' caption='Context menu for a client'/>
	Selecting the <button type="pressed" name="Set AC Server"/> option in client's context menu,
	brings up the sub-menu presented in Figure 4. The top line indicates the name of the client system for
	which the context menu was displayed.
