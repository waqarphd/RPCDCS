      The header of the panel contains the button which allows the selection
      of the mode of operation (modes of operation will be explained below) and
      a selection box for selecting the DIP API manager config DP. Each DIP API
      manager uses a separate config.
      <p>
      <b>DIP Manager</b> section provides some basic operations on the API
      Manager and on the DIP config DPs. There are three sections:
      <ul>
      <li> Config related actions - adding new config and removing the existing
      	one. These options should not be generally used.
      <li> Browser Cache - allows to issue the command to the API Manager
      	to regenerate the cache with the DIP hierarchy. It is necessary
	to view newly published publications.
      <li> Queries - allows to specify how long to wait for the response from
        the API Manager. The default should not be tweaked.
      </ul>
      </p>
      <b>Subscribtions</b> - The combo box &quot;Subscribed Services&quot;
      contains the list of all the DIP publications that the API manager is
      currently subscribed to (it is analogous to list in the fwDipView in
      &quot;Subscribed Services&quot; view). The table below contains the
      detailed information about subscriptions of selected DIP publication -
      which dpes are being subscribed to which DIP tags.<br>
      Panel allows to unsubscribe from all the dpes in the table or to
      unsubscribe only the selected dpe. These operations are invoked by using
      &quot;Unsubscribe&quot; and &quot;Unsubscribe dpe&quot; buttons
      <p>
      The &quot;New Subscription&quot; part of the panels allows to subscribe
      to:
      	<ul>
		<li> simple publications (*)
		<li> single fields of complex publications (*)
		<li> complex publications (**)
	</ul>
      The combo box allows to choose the mode of operation - <i>simple</i>&nbsp;(*)
      and <i>complex</i>&nbsp;(**). Depending on the selection the displayed 
      fields change.<br>
      For <i>simple</i> mode - the user has to select the publication by means
      of the browser and select the dpe from the selector.<br>
      For <i>complex</i> mode - the user has to select the publication and then
      after clicking the &quot;Add Subscription&quot; button the panel for
      complex subscribtion will appear (fwDipEditDptCreate).
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Publications</b>  - The combo box &quot;Published Services&quot;
      contains the list of all the publications that are being published
      (it is analogous to list in the fwDipView in &quot;Published
      Services&quot; view). The table below contains the detailed information
      about the structure of the selected publication - which dpes are being
      published under which DIP tags.<br>
      
      In order to unpublish the publication it is necessary to click the
      &quot;Del Publication&quot; button.<br>
      
      Creation of the new publication is started by clicking the &quot;Add
      Publication&quot; button. Then one has to insert <b>at least</b> one
      tag into the publication by filling the fields in the bottom part of the
      panel. It is necessary to click &quot;Save changes&quot; button in order
      to finish the creation of the publication.<br>
      
      One can also modify the existing publication - it is possible to add
      additional fields or remove existing ones (by selecting a row from a table
      and clicking the &quot;Del dpe&quot; button. All changes are commited
      only after clicking the &quot;Save changes&quot; button. In order to reset
      the data (undo the unsaved changes), one has to click &quot;Reload&quot;
      button
