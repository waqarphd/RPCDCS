The Device Editor and Navigator is the entry panel of the Framework.
Most of the Framework functionality is available navigating from it. <br>
The user can work in two modes, Editor and Navigator. The Editor mode
is meant to create/remove and configure the required devices inside
PVSS.&nbsp; Once they are configured, then the user can switch to
Navigator mode to do basic operations to setup device specific
parameters.<br>

The panel is organized in three tabs (Hardware, Logical, FSM)
reflecting the steps necessary to configure the necessary for your
application.&nbsp; Each tab has two different working modes: Editor and
Navigator.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; 1. Hardware View (<a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1</a>):
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">The first step when creating your
application is to instantiate and set up inside PVSS the representation
of the devices you are using (e.g. high voltage crates, temperature
sensors, etc). This is done in the Hardware View. In this view the
devices are organized in vendor nodes&nbsp; (e.g.&nbsp; CAEN,
Wiener).&nbsp; The following actions are available when right clicking
in the tree in Editor mode (for more details go to the help of the
specific panel):<br>
      </div>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <li>Add: to create new devices in PVSS and configure them with
the default settings.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Clone: to copy a subtree of devices keeping their
configuration.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Remove: to delete a subtree of devices. It actually deletes
the devices from PVSS.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Settings: to configure a subtree of devices. It is also
possible to configure a part of the tree selected according to some
criteria.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Properties: displays all the elements of the selected
device together with the configuration for each of them.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Expand: expands the node in the tree.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Configuration DB: if the Configuration DB tool is
installed, a panel will pop-up to deal with the storage and retrieval
of the selected subtree in a database.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">At the system level node the
following options are available:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Open Installation Tool: opens the Installation Tool<br>
        </li>
        <li>System settings: to set system parameters. Currently only
the help browser is specified. <br>
        </li>
        <li>Settings: to configure all the devices in the hardware
tree. It is also possible to configure a subset selected according to
some criteria.</li>
        <li>Register device type: registers an existing PVSS datapoint
type as a Framework device.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Inactive alarms: lists all the alarms in the system which
are inactive (masked). These are alarms for which the alarm condition
is still evaluated, but no alarm is raised when the alarm condition is
raised.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      </div>
2. Logical View (<a href="fwDeviceEditorNavigator.htm#Figure_2">Figure 2</a>):<br>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">After the hardware representation
has been created, one can move to the organization of devices in
logical units. This is done in the Logical and FSM views. In the
Logical view be can group devices at a low level to build units that
will be used afterwards in the FSM hierarchy.&nbsp; The following
actions are available when right clicking in the tree in
Editor mode (for more details go to the help of the specific panel):</div>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <li>Add -&gt; Add Node: creates an empty logical node.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Add -&gt; Add From Hardware: to add devices created in the
hardware view to a logical node.</li>
        <li>Remove: to remove a subtree from the Logical tree. The
devices are not removed from PVSS. Simply their alias is set to null.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Cut: moves a subtree of devices to the clipboard.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Paste: takes a subtree of devices from the clipboard and
puts it as child of the selected device.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Rename: changes the logical name (PVSS alias) of the
selected device.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Settings: to configure a subtree of devices. It is also
possible to configure a part of the tree selected according to some
criteria.</li>
        <li>Properties: displays all the elements of the selected
device together with the configuration for each of them.</li>
        <li>Expand: expands the node in the tree.</li>
        <li>Configuration DB: if the Configuration DB tool is
installed, a panel will pop-up to deal
with the storage and retrieval of the selected subtree in a database.</li>
      </ul>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">some of these actions might be
disabled depending on the type of the selected device. At the system
level node the
following options are available:</div>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <li>Add -&gt; Add Node: creates an empty logical node.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Add -&gt; Add From Hardware: to add devices created in the
hardware view to a logical node.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Paste: to paste a subtree available in the clipboard.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Settings: to configure all the devices in the logical tree.
It is also possible to configure a subset selected according to some
criteria.</li>
        <li>Open Installation Tool: opens the Installation Tool</li>
      </ul>
3. FSM View:<br>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Here is where you can add
behaviour to the devices in the Hardware and Logical views. For more
details on how to use it you can have a look in the home page of the
fwFSM component <a href="http://clara.home.cern.ch/clara/fw/FwFsm.html">fwFSM.</a><br>
