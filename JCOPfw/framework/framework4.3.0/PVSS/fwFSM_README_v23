08-7-2005 Release Notes for FwFsm v23r15

Linked with:
    - DIM v15r19
    - SMI++ v27r2
    - PVSS 3.0 Official Release

Fixes:
    - Replaced the executable of PVSS00smi, it was not exiting anymore when issuing
      a "Stop All" command - fixed.

30-6-2005 Release Notes for FwFsm v23r14

Linked with:
    - DIM v15r19
    - SMI++ v27r2
    - PVSS 3.0 Official Release

Improvements:
    - Optimized the operation panels:
      The states and possible actions for each object type are picked up at startup
      (not at every state change)
    - Allows for lowercase letters in FSM names (states and actions).
    - Includes the new "stay_in_state" directive for when clauses
      (not from the wizard, has to be edited by hand)
    - New Partition mode: LockedOut
      To avoid an excluded CU to be automatically included by mistake.
    - Fixed a bug wish prevented correctly setting the main Operation panel
      for a full FSM tree.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented FSM User panels to be stored anywhere else
      than the project path. Now they can be in any of the paths in the config 
      file.

21-3-2005 Release Notes for FwFsm v23r13

Linked with:
    - DIM v15r4
    - SMI++ v24r2
    - PVSS 3.0 Official Release

Improvements:
    - Added a new set of functions to retrieve the hierarchy nodes and the FSM
      types in the fwCU library.
    - The indication that devices were disabled down in the hierarchy (a yellow
      box around the control unit lock) was not working properly - fixed.


16-3-2005 Release Notes for FwFsm v23r12

Linked with:
    - DIM v15r4
    - SMI++ v24r2
    - PVSS 3.0 Official Release

Improvements:
    - Fixed a bug introduced in v23r11 by which in same cases the DP name passed
      to a user panel for a device unit (as $2) contained twice the system name.
    - Fixed a bug which prevented, in some cases, modifying the settings of a 
      device unit (like user panel name or visibility).
    - The two bugs above appeared when a device unit was added to the FSM from 
      the Hardware view but it also existed in a logical view. Another side effect
      of this problem was that the default label of a device unit added from the
      HW view was the logical name of the device.
    - In order to prevent all these problems, devices added from the HW view will
      be created internally with the HW name instead of the logical name (if they
      had one) as previously.
    - A user panel associated to a device unit was overwritten by a "Generate"
      FSM command - fixed.
    - Some order was added in general to the user panel features:
      - A user panel can be specified per CU or DU type (by default the name of
        this panel is: <type_name>.pnl
      - A user panel can also be specified individualy for a DU or CU.
      - When opening a panel, the induvidual user panel if it exists is open
        otherwise the type panel is open if it exists.
      - Changing the user panel for the type will not affect the individual panel 
        settings.
      - In order to remove an individual panel, an empty panel string should be
        given. This will revert the user panel back to the type panel.
    - Added to fwFsmTree library functions for starting and stopping FSM processes.
    - The visibility state of children of a certain DU was not taken into account
      when calculating the operations panel size - fixed.    
 

3-3-2005 Release Notes for FwFsm v23r11

Linked with:
    - DIM v15r4
    - SMI++ v24r2
    - PVSS 3.0 Official Release

Improvements:
    - Now it is possible to add as device units datapoint elements (in the past
      only top-level datapoints). This create a "logical view" of the DP element.
      To be used with care.
    - Created a new library of functions: fwFsmTree
      Allows a user to dynamically create FSM Trees.
 
7-2-2005 Release Notes for FwFsm v23r10

Linked with:
    - DIM v15r4
    - SMI++ v24r2
    - PVSS 3.0 Official Release

Improvements:
    - Fixed a bug when "Taking" a tree, the command was not correctly propagated
      down the hierarchy
    - Some minor changes on CU and DU type configuration panels:
	- Now can change the order of states also for DUs
	- The DU "Simple Config" no longer accepts an end-state 
	  (it was confusing for the users)
    - Operation panels can now show the same ordering as given in the Device 
      Editor Navigator. Before the ordering was always: local objects, then CUs 
      and finally DUs.
    - Fixed a bug that did not allow creating Object types with a name starting by
      the name of a device unit type (based type).

4-2-2005 Release Notes for FwFsm v23r9

Linked with:
    - DIM v15r4
    - SMI++ v24r2
    - PVSS 3.0 Official Release

Improvements:
    - Fixed a bug which would generate an endless loop when adding CUs from another
      system
    - Fixed a bug in the Majority panel for Linux

31-1-2005 Release Notes for FwFsm v23r8

Linked with:
    - DIM v15r4
    - SMI++ v24r2
    - PVSS 3.0 Official Release

Improvements:
    - Fixed a bug in the latest version related to the starting up of DU scripts.
      Now instead of a ctrl script per system, there will be one per Control
      Unit (if it has at least one DU).
    - Fixed a bug in the automatic FSM generation when adding several CUs at the
      same time.
    - Modified the standard Majority object (FwDevMajority) to accept also positive
      logic and to take into account the Disabled/Enabled state of the Devices or 
      Objects.
    - Added a print button in the "Overview" panel for an object/DU type.
    - The Device script executed by a DU to calculate a new state, would always
      provoque a state change (even if to the same state). Now the user can check
      (using fwDU_getState(...)) what the current state is and if he doesn't want
      to trigger a state change he/she can return fwState = "".
      This can be usefull for efficiency reasons and also to not re-trigger when
      conditions.
    - Fixed a bug in FwFSM which coud provoke an endless loop when generating FSMs


25-11-2004 Release Notes for FwFsm v23r7

Linked with:
    - DIM v15r4
    - SMI++ v24r2
    - PVSS 3.0 Official Release

Improvements:
    - Added a standard Majority object: FwDevMajority
      (can be added from the Add Object button)
    - Fixed a bug opening user panels on distributed systems:
	now the hardware device name including the system name is passed as $2
    - Got rid of the CMD processes
    - Modified the ctrl stript that implements the FSM for DUs, now only the DUs 
      of the started domains get to run. 
      (Before all of them were restarted everytime)
    - Removed a series of prints from smiSM and PVSS00smi


04-11-2004 Release Notes For FwFSM v23r6:

Linked with:
    - DIM v15r1
    - SMI++ v23r1
    - PVSS 3.0 Official Release

Improvements:
    - Changed the tree display in order to make it faster, it now selectively
      adds nodes only when adding/removing or expanding/collapsing the tree.
    - Also the automatic FSM generation is now selective, only re-generates
      the necessary CUs
    - Fixed a bug on the starting up of device units. It would not work
      properly for big numbers of DUs

26-10-2004 Release Notes For FwFSM v23r5:

Linked with:
    - DIM v15r1
    - SMI++ v23r1
    - PVSS 3.0 Official Release

Improvements:
    - The fact that one or more devices are disabled is now propagated
      through the hierarchy panels.
	- So excluded domains became orange
	- and disabled devices are now yellow
    - Some prints were removed in particular the "dim_send_command" ones.
    - "Exclude" will no longer propagate down the hierarchy, i.e:
	- When a CU is excluded, only this one is cut-off from the tree
	- Its children will stay included, so that the control logic will
	  stay valid.
	- On the other hand the ownership still propagates, i.e. all 
	  children of an excluded CU will have no owner (until the CU
	  is "Taken" again).
    - Changed "Return" into "Release" (also in fwCU library)
    - Included "ReleaseAll" and "excludeAll" (also in fwCU)
    - Fixed finally the installation for Linux, no need to define OS or 
      OSTYPE.
    - Fixed a bug that made the PVSS event manager loop and take all the 
      memory, this had two causes:
	- smiSM was sometimes looping and sending more messages than 
          needed - fixed.
        - PVSS00smi was doing one of the dpSets outside the main thread
	  which if it happened at the same time as another dpSet could
	  cause a currupted message to be sent to the EV manager - fixed.
    - Fixed the FSM Alarm panel to use new AES version.
    - Automatically adds fwFSMSrvr and the DeviceEditorNavigator to the
      console
    - Fixed a limitation on DNS and on PVSS00smi that couldn't handle more
      than 32 CUs on Windows

Linked with:
    - DIM v15r0
    - SMI++ v23r0
    - PVSS 3.0 Official Release

Improvements:
    - The tree panels for editor and navigator views of the same tree
      are now synchronized, when the user expands or collapses a node
      the same operation takes place in the other view.
      This affects the FSM tree and the Trending tree
    - Fixed a bug in the tree library, when a node was renamed it left
      some ghost nodes in the clipboard
    - The user panels for FSM operation receive as parameters the control
      unit name and the object/device name. The device name is now the
      hardware name (i.e. the datapoint name) and not the logical name,
      as was the case in the previous version by mistake.
    - There was a bug generating SML code for objects with no children,
      fixed.
    - When changing a penel name in an object/device type this was not
      taken into account by the actual instances. fixed.
    - The control manager which runs the device unit's scripts is now
      started without an explicit manager number.
    - Now a device/object Type can not be removed if there are instances
      of this type.
    - Fixed a bug in the Device Unit Type scripts wizard, dp element types
      were changed to boolean by mistake.
    - If in a distributed system one of the systems in the FSM is down
      this is now reported in the message window  

Release Notes For FwFSM v23r3:

Linked with:
    - DIM v14r7
    - SMI++ v20r1
    - PVSS 3.0 Official Release

Major Changes:
    - The Tree structure has changed.
	- Trees now have a Top level node for each tree with a clipboard
	- Trees can contain several nodes with the same name.
	- Tree nodes can contain user defined data
      	- The Tree library has changed accordingly.
      	- Generic Tree display panels (in fwTreeDisplay) are available
	  to add, remove, rename or reorder nodes.
      	- A generic tree display main panel is also available as a reference
	  panel (fwTreeDisplay/fwTree.pnl) 
    - Allow users to define their own FSM display look.
	- Several calls available in scripts/libs/fwFsmUi.ctl
	- Can be used by modifying panels/fwFSMuser/fwUi.pnl
Other Improvements:
      - The environment variable "OSTYPE" is now used instead of "OS"
	to check if running on Linux.
      - When adding devices from "Logical view", if the logical name is
	changed to point to another HW channel, only a "Restart" of the
	FSM is needed (No need to Regenerate). 
      - The Start/Stop/Restart was improoved to not leave any processes
	running.
      - When deleting nodes with children the children go to the clipboard
	instead of staying around as ghosts.
      - Import DU/CU type from file also parses parameters. 
      - DU labels now only contain the name after the "/".
      - If the PVSS system name changes, The FSM Tree will be automatically
	updated when restarting the fwDeviceEditorNavigator.
