*********** Demo not yet Available ************

Improvements:
      - Fixed the color selection for Object states
      - Added the possibility of changing the order of when conditions
      - Added the possibility of changing the order of states
	( to allow setting the first one as initial state)
      - Now all script editors use the standard PVSS script editor
      - Hopefully set the font of SMI action and when editors to courrier
      - Added the possibility to check if individual bits are set or clear
	in the Device State Script wizard (for int, bit32 and unsigned variables)
      - When importing types from a remote system the BaseType flag on the
	remote system is checked and added to the local system
      - Added the system name as top node in both FSM views. Actions to all
	trees can be done from this node.
	"Create Root Node" and "Generate All FSMs" are now available there,
	as well as "paste" see bellow.
	(This is for compatibility with the other FW views)
      - Added a button to Edit FSM types on the FSM editor view
	( now the "FSM Types" tab can be removed)
      - Added a Clipboard node on the FSM "Editor" view. All cut nodes will
	go inside.
	They can then be pasted inside other nodes or at the top level (via
	the menu on the system name)
	The last cut node will be remembered and can be pasted directly, for
	other nodes in the clipboard the user has to "cut" them from the
	clipboard in order to paste them somewhere else. 
	Nodes in the clipboard will be ignored by "Generate ALL FSMs", 
	"Stop ALL" or "Restart ALL"
      - Added the possibility of re-ordering nodes inside a control unit (right
	mouse button for a selected node in the FSM "Editor" view). Only the
	order of control units inside the selected control unit will be affected.
	Devices and local objects will still be displayed in alphabetical order.
      - The PVSS00smi Api Manager is no longer started by default at fwFsmSrvr
	startup. Will only be started on the first "Restart" of a Node, Tree or
	ALL.
      - When users change DIM_DNS_NODE a "stop ALL" will automatically be sent.  

Release Notes For FwFSM v20r10:

Linked with:
    - DIM v13r8
    - SMI++ v18r2
    - PVSS Candidate Release 3.0

**** NOT Compatible with Versions before v20 ****
*********** Demo not yet Available ************

Improvements:
      - Made several more widgets not editable by the user to avoid 
        mistakes
      - Now uses the PVSS script editor to edit Device Type Scripts 
      - When addind a type from a remote system the list was not
	refreshed anymore - fixed
      - Made some changes to make it easier for a user to create
	objects and domains from ctrl scripts
      - Fixed the Linux instalation to use also /bin instead of /linux
      - The ENABLE/DISABLE device unit had stopped working - fixed
      - Object types, device scripts and sml code are now backed up
	(once) when modified (in the directories smi_back and 
	scripts/libs_back)
      - These could be imported back by using the "Import From File"
	button (Device scripts can be imported and will work but the
	information in "simple config" is not completely restored yet)
      - As a side effect of the 3 above changes all the files generated
	in the smi and scripts/libs directories have different names
	and extensions
	-> Users will have to do "generate ALL" after installing this
	   version.

	Devices can be added "As Base Type", see release notes for v20r5
      - Fixed a few bugs related to distributed systems:
	      - Generate All - generated the wrong code when systems
		were disconnected
	      - The user interface didn't reconnect when systems 
		reconnected.
      - Fixed the Linux distribution. Now both linux and windows
	executables are in the /bin directory

      - DIM_DNS_NODE can be defined in the FSM/Navigator panel.
	No nedd for the environment variable
      - No need to add anything to the path in Windows
	and no need to modify PATH or LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Linux
      - MSVCRTD.DLL is also distributed
      - There is only one popup message when Adding nodes and/or
        generating FSMs (less confusing for the user).
      - PVSS00smi now kills all smiSM and then exits when the project
	stops. 

V20r5:
Linked with:
    - DIM v13r4
    - SMI++ v18r2
    - PVSS Candidate Release 3.0

**** NOT Compatible with Previous Versions ****
****** Currently only tested on WINDOWS *******
*********** Demo not yet Available ************

Fixes the following bugs:
    - Add Device Type would allow adding several times the same
      device type - fixed.
    - PVSS00smi was passing SMI parameters incorrectly into PVSS

Includes the following upgrades:
    - Any Device Unit type can be made base type (right mouse button)
      This was already the case for FwAi, FwAo, FwDi, FwDo and FwNode.
      A base type means that the same device type can have several
      different behaviours (i.e. FSMs). This was necessary for example
      for FwElmbAi, etc.
    - In order to use a node in the logical (or hardware) tree as a 
      DU two new dpElements fwState and fwCommand, both integers, were
      added to FwNode -> Ask the FW developpers to add it in.
    - A new wizard for the "set" SMI instruction was added.
      Set allows setting the value of SMI Object Parameters.
    - Made more clear, in the object type definition, how to add object
      parameters and action parameters.

v20r4:
    - New FSM version distributed with the Framework 2.0.3
