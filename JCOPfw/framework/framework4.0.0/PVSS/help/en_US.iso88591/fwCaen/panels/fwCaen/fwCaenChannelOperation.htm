      <td colspan="2">The left table represents the requested
parameters that can be set for a CAEN channel, and the right table the
actual values read from the channel.<br>
      <br>
In the left table, the column Settting contains the values sent to the
hardware. The column ReadBack contains the values that are actually
stored in the hardware. It is possible to ask for a different value by
clicking on the column Setting
and the row of the paremeter you want to change. A popup panel will ask
you to enter a new value. After the refresh period of the OPC group to
which the parameter is assigned, the value in the ReadBack column will
change, indicating that the hardware has received it. If it is not the
case, then either the connection to the Power Supply or the Power
Supply itself is not working correctly.<br>
Just after opening the panel,&nbsp; if the Setting and ReadBack columns
differ, it could be because somebody else is or was connected to the
same channel and requested a different value. In this case you can ask
to 'Load the settings from the hardware' into the Setting column. <br>
      <br>
In the right table, the operational values read from the hardware are
shown. <br>
      <br>
With the Commands buttons (On/Off) it is possible to switch On and Off
the Channel.<br>
      <br>
The Action button allows to do the standard Framework Device operations:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -Mask/Unmask/Acknowledge Alarms<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -Enable/Disable the channel<br>

addition to the standard channels, CAEN calls channels to other type of
objects (e.g. power supply to Easy system boards). These other
possibilities will be considered in a future version of the panel.<br>
