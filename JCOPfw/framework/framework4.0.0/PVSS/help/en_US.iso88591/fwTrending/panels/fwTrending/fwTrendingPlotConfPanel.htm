        Plots. A Trending Plot is a trending  display that can show up to
        8 curves.</p>

    <tr valign="top">
      <td bgcolor="#00cc00"><strong>Instructions</strong></td>
      <td colspan="2"><p>When creating a new plot, you should first enter a Plot
          Name and Plot Title in the corresponding fields. The Plot Name will
          be used as the data point name of the plot configuration. This is the
          name used to refer to the plot configuration in CTRL scripts. The Plot
          Title is intended to be a more descriptive text which explains the
          data shown or the purpose of the plot. The Plot Title can be useful
          to help identify which plot is which when browsing through lists of
          plots.</p>
        <p>Then you specify the general characteristics of the plot, such as
          the X axis time range, the foreground and background colours. There
          are also settings to choose if you want to show the default PVSS legend
          (not selected by default), have a grid to help read the trend of if
          you want a logrithmic Y scale.</p>
        <p>Next there are 8 rows of settings which represent each of the 8 curves
          on the plot. You can fill in whichever and however many rows you wish.
          To set a curve, you first choose a row and then enter the data point
          element to be plotted. You can type this manually in the first column
          or choose it from the data point selector by pressing the &quot;...&quot; button.
          Once you have chosen a data point element, the &quot;Legend Text&quot; column
          will automatically be filled in with a text. You can change this text
          as you wish.</p>
        <p>After this you can set some parameters of the curve such as colour,
          line style and curve visibility. To choose a curve colour you should
          press the coloured square and a colour picker will appear. You can
          pick a line type from any of the options in the combo box. These are
          Points, Steps or Linear. An additional option called Individual is
          available in the 9th row (see below). To toggle the visibility of the
          curve, you can press the button with the
          eye
          on it.
          When the
          eye
          is
          crossed
          out
          that curve is invisible, and when not crossed out the curve will be
          visible.</p>
        <p>Next, you can control the Y axis for each curve. You can set the visibility
          (again pressing a button to toggle the visibility) and can choose automatic
          scaling (by checking the &quot;Auto&quot; checkbox) or manually selected
          min and max curve limits.</p>
        <p>Finally, the last column of the row shows if an archiving config exists
          for the selected data point. If you have sufficient user permissions,
          you can also click the &quot;...&quot; button to view and adjust the archiving
          configuration.</p>
        <p>To speed up the configuration of many curves, there is a 9th row which
          can be used to set some settings for all 8 curves at the same time.
          These include the curve line type, curve visibility, scale visibility
          and the Y scale range (manual and automatic). By changing these settings
          in the 9th row, the other 8 rows will be immediately updated. <a name="IndividualLineType"></a>Selecting
          the line type of the curve in the 9th row allows you to set all 8 curves
          to one of the supported types (Points, Steps, Linear) or alternatively
          you can select the Individual option. This lets you choose a different
          line type for each of the 8 curves individually.</p>
        <p>In this row, you can also choose the plot marker type. By default this will be a filled circle - this setting draws a small dot for each point of data that is drawn in the plot. One option is to show no marker at all in which case you only see the curve with no special marking for each point of data.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> There are some considerations when choosing the marker type:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>If you selected the curve type &quot;Points&quot; then you should not select marker type &quot;None&quot;. This would result in seeing neither the curve, nor the points. You would see nothing.</li>
          <li>If you think you will have many thousands of points visible on the plot, then it is recommended to use marker type &quot;None&quot;. This makes the display clearer and also avoids a problem associated with high CPU load when showing many plot markers on the plot at the same time. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>You do not need to fill every curve in the plot. Once
          you have filled all the required positions on the plot, you should
          save
          the
          plot by
          clicking
          OK or Apply.
          Clicking
          Cancel
          will
          close the
          panel without saving the plot. The Save as... button can be used to
          save the  displayed plot configuration to another data point.</p>
        <p>If you are modifying an existing plot, you will have all the options
        as above except that the Plot Name will not be modifyable.</p>
        <p>If you wish, you can use a template parameter in the Plot Title, DP
          Element and Legend Text. A template parameter is defined by placing
          the variable name between curly brackets,
        { }. So the Plot Title could be  HVChannels{myVariable}. Where {myVariable}
        is substituted by another
      value at a later time.</p></td>
