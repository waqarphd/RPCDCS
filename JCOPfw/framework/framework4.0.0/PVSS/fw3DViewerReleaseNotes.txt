10 April 2008: prototype version 0.0.1
--------------------------------------

This is the first prototype presented to the experiments.
It has the functionality of the initial CMS's implementation of the
3D widget - it allows to display a 3D scene made of geometrical
shapes, manipulate the shape properties and select the shape with
the mouse. 

The scene is created from a PVSS script in a panel. The widget is
generic - it does not connect to any database, to extract the geometrical
information. It is up to the developer of the panel to use the
widget's function to create shapes, then to alter their properties
(colour, transparency) in response to user actions or PVSS state.

This prototype version does not contain any documentation. It only
provides example panels that demonstrate the functionality. One might
explore the functionality by analyzing the code of the panels.

Please note that the API, i.e. the names of functions and events
exposed in the widget is supposed to change! Also, being the first
prototype, this version may contain bugs that may crash your PVSS UI.
Therefore, DO NOT use this version in any production system

Note also that the widget may crash the GEDI on Windows,
in certain circumstances. This is when you want to open a panel
(that includes the widget) in GEDI, and the "Open File" dialog
box is in the mode that shows a preview of the panel. 
To overcome this problem simply switch the "Open File" dialog
box to display a flat list of files (using the buttons at its
top).
