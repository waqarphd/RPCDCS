    - Linux executables built on: SLC4 with gcc 3.4.6

Bug Fixes/Improvements:
    - Corrected a bug in the "Copy from Type" panel, it generated an error in the log.
    - Added a new FSM Feature (sub-type handling):
	If an object is of type XXX___&YYY (YYY will be considered a subType of XXX)
	The object will be considered of type XXX by its parent, i.e. all actions or conditions
        for (all or any) objects of type XXX will include this child. 
        But the type can declare extra actions and the parent will be able to send these actions
        only to the children of the sub-type (using the normal "do action on all children of type XXX")
	This is usefull if an object of a certain type is different only in that it accepts
        more actions that the others.
	Limitations: only works for Control Units and if the states are exactly the same.
    - New colorDB file for compatibility with other FW components.
    - in PVSS00smi got rid of the inital message about heart_beat dp not existing.

    - Linux executables built on: SLC4 with gcc 3.4.6

Bug Fixes/Improvements:
    - New versions of DIM & SMI++
    - SMI++ v33:
	- Optimized the handling of "When" conditions
        - Should be much faster for large CUs (with many children)
    - DisallowedOperations prevents the user from excluding/including objects in certain
      states, depending on their FSM Object type.
    	- Changed the disallowed Operations to allow also disabling inclusion/exclusion 
          while the object is busy. By using the keyword: FwFsmBUSY instead of a state name.
    - Hopefully fixed the fact that FSM panels started as scattered UIs didn't die when the
      project was restarted. They stayed hung forever.
    - Improovements in the FSM Operate Tree:
	- Faster on expanding tree (only one hidden child is included, not all)
	- Can now choose to open panels on single click or right click (default)
		- by using fwFsmUi_setOnpenOnSingleClick(2)
		- or in the DEN FSM Editor Tree "Settings"
	- Now uses the actual system name of children, instead of the one used when adding
          the children (more robust, since people change system names)
	- Will now try to reconnect when a system was not running at panel startup
          (before the PVSS00ui had to be restarted)
	- Now accepts expand requests also when expanding (before they were ignored)
        - The Operate Tree panel can now be started with a $id parameter, and it will
          take that identity (ownership) at startup.
    - Fixed a bug in the FSM panels, which made them get slower and slower everytime
      new panels were opened.
    - Imporooved fwFsmSrvr to wait until PVSS00smi dies at Stop ALL, to avoid service
      alredy exists errors in the DNS.

      cleared when a new action was selected.
    - When a node is taken or included, the report specifying locked out children
      is now a table with a scroll bar.
    - When the FSM started before all systems are connected (normally the case when
      the start fsm at project startup flag is set), the system name of some CUs was
      incorrectly set as the local system and never recovered until the FSM was stopped
      and restarted - fixed.
    - fwCU_connectState now accepts an extra optional parameter. A wait flag meaning:
      if the PVSS system where this node is running is not connected, wait for it to
      be connected and then connect to the state changes.
    - Restart FSM Command now available only to "expert" level access control.
    - The owner of a CU wich had a child in Manual and Taken by someone else, could not
      exclude this child. Fixed

    - DIM v16r13
    - SMI++ v32r4
    - PVSS 3.6 (only)

Bug Fixes/Improvements:
    - A callback parameter has been added to fwDU_startTimeout, the callback will be called
      when the device timesout so that the user can do something, for example, send a message
      to the alarm screen.
    - When devices where "permanently" disabled, their alarms where still taken into account
      by the alarm button, fixed.
    - When there were many children in an FSM Operations panel, and the user scrolled down to
      open a child panel, this panel would open outside the screen, fixed.
    - New features in the FSMOperate panel (fwTreeDisplay/fwTree.pnl with parameters: 
      $1=FSM and $2=operator):
	- Shows colors only for nodes where this manager is the owner, otherwise they are grey.
	- Left click shows information about the state of the node
	- Rigth click still opens the panel
	- Allows changing Identity (by using fwFsmUi_changeIdentity(string newId))
    - The users can now "overload" the following functions:
	- "Click" on Object button (default does nothing)
	- "Double Click" on Object button (default opens child node panel)
	- "view", called by fwCU_view, by the deviceEditorNavigator FSM tree navigator "view" 
	  and by The FSMOperate panel right click (default opens node panel)
	  - In order to do this the user can add in the file fwFsmUser.ctl the following functions
	    (respectively):
		fwFsmUser_nodeClicked(string domain, string obj, string parent = "")
		fwFsmUser_nodeDoubleClicked(string domain, string obj, string parent = "")
		fwFsmUser_nodeView(string domain, string obj, int x = -1, int y = -1)
    - The following functions have been added to the user callback list:
	- fwFsmUser_nodeExcludedRec(string parent, string node)
	- fwFsmUser_nodeExcludedAllRec(string parent, string node)
	- fwFsmUser_nodeIncludedRec(string parent, string node)
      These are called for all children (recursively) when they are included or excluded.
    - Added the possibility of "Forcefully" Excluding or Releasing nodes taken by somebody else.
    - Fixed a bug in PVSS00smi, sometimes it could send a new command to a DU before clearing the
      "executingAction" for the previous command, which would make the FSM configurator behave
      incorrectly.

	- Now shows the whole FSM tree (all levels)
	- The icon shows the current state color
	- Can open directly any panel with a right click

    - Fixed a few bugs related to distributed systems (fwFsm_isObjectReference, fwTree)
    - fwCU_view Now accepts 2 optional parameters: The x and y coordinates of where to
      place the panel.

    - Device editor Navigator FSM Tree could hang when displaying an empty tree - fixed.
    - The FSMOperate panel did not show the whole FSM hierarchy (only the first level) - fixed.

    - At installation:
	- Now the file fwFsmUser,ctl should be properly handled
	- Only the files fwUi.pnl and logo.pnl are copied to the panels/fwFsmUser directory

    - DIM v16r13
    - SMI++ v29r3
    - PVSS 3.6 (only)

Bug Fixes/Improvements:
    - One small feature of the control manager per DU option introduced in the previous
      version was incompatible with fwFsmConfDB - fixed (back to as it used to be)
    - The "LockedOut" state is now remembered when the FSMs are restarted 
    - Taking/Releasing/Including nodes accross distributed systems sometimes didn't 
      work - fixed.
    - fwDU_startTimeout() still didn't work completely - hopefully fixed.
    - Fixed a few bugs in the FSM tree Widget:
	- The Tree refresh didn't work properly when adding nodes from FSM tree
	- The "Rename" node also didn't refresh the tree properly
    - Added a Message in the log to report that a DP for a DU doesn't exist and is being
      created, when "Generating" FSM.
    - Tried to remove a few PVSS error messages related to alarm configs when "Removing"
      nodes from the FSM tree.
    - Created a new function to return all object actions for use by FwFSMConfDB.
    - Fixed a bug by which the shared/exclusive flag of a CU was not properly "remembered".


13-06-2007 Release Notes for FwFsm v25r7
    - DIM v16r13
    - SMI++ v29r3
    - PVSS 3.6 (only)

Bug Fixes/Improvements:
    - Introduced a new option:
	Normally There is one ctrl manager for the whole PVSS system that runs:
	- 1 separate script (using execScript()) per CU. 
          This one in turn:
		- starts a thread per DU
    	For the cases where there are only a few (less than 50) but heavy DUs
        (for example that need to load and apply large recipies), one single ctrl
        manager was a limitation.
        - A new option of one ctrl manager per DU can now be set in the "Settings"
        panel for a CU. The CU Tree nedds then to be (Stop All/)Restarted.
		- The tree should be slower to start but faster to execute. 
    - Made available fwFsmUi_report() with an extra parameter specifying a
      CU name. The message will be displayed in that CU panel if the panel is open.
      This mechanism can now be used even from a background ctrl script.
    - Sometimes Start/Restart Node or Tree did not properly stop the DU scripts before
      restarting them, which would cause DUs to execute every command twice - Fixed.
 

18-05-2007 Release Notes for FwFsm v25r6
    - DIM v16r13
    - SMI++ v29r3
    - PVSS 3.6 (only)

Bug Fixes/Improvements:
    - fwDU_startTimeout() was not working correctly for DUs in the same CU - fixed.
    - Fixed several bugs in the manipulation of the FSM tree widget.
    - Fixed a problem opening the Parameters panel when sending a command on Linux 
      (wrong upper/lowercase).
    - Fixed a bug in FwDevMode (initialization script).


26-04-2007 Release Notes for FwFsm v25r5
    - DIM v16r9
    - SMI++ v29r3
    - PVSS 3.6 (only)

Bug Fixes/Improvements:
    - The file fwFsmUser.ctl used to overwrite the one prepared by the user at installation
      time - fixed.
    - Fixed the behaviour of FwChildMode and FwMode for allowing only the proper actions.
    - Fixed a bug in the config_device_states panel, used to produce errors.
    - Import from file did not import the "visibility flag for actions or the panel name
      for the object type- fixed (for object types created with version > v25r5)
    - Adjusted the fwUi panel for the new AccessControl version (bigger widget)
    - Messages reporting problems taking/including objects had stopped being reported
      since the "Take" mechanism became distributed. - fixed.
    - As a result the users can now use fwUi_report() with an extra parameter specifying a
      CU name, and the message will be displayed in that CU panel if the panel is open. This
      mechanism can be used even from a background ctrl script.
    - Changed the mechanism of start/Restart to make sure all "DEAD" objects are reported 
      properly and that children of stopped domains are automatically excluded.
    - When a child CU is stopped and/or restarted it will be put in "Manual" state. So that
      it's state is still taken into account (eithet the DEAD state or the state at startup)
      but no commands are sent to it unitil the use Includes it.
      (Of course it can be Excluded by the user at any point in time).
    - Now when doing STOP ALL all running smiSMs (in the PVSS project) will be stopped, 
      even the ones that have been deleted in the meantime.
    - When a new user logged in his priviledges were not taken into account by the action list
      in the objects (i.e. the new user could still do expert actions even without that right).
      This has been fixed.
    - Actions following a disabled expert action were shown as disabled - fixed.
    - SMI executables (smiSM, etc.) are looked for in the project path and not anymore in the
      path given by installationDirectory (give by the fwInstallation tools), this allows better
      handling of copied projects (if the user remembers to copy also the directory where
      components are installed and changes the config file by hand).
    - Fized a bug in fwUi.pnl that prevented it being opened directly from the console as:
	PVSS00ui -p fwFSMuser/fwUi.pnl,"$node:MyCUName","$obj:MyCUName" -iconBar -menuBar
    

10-04-2007 Release Notes for FwFsm v25r4
    - DIM v16r9
    - SMI++ v29r3
    - PVSS 3.6 (only)

Bug Fixes/Improvements:
    - Allowed the possibility of passing as FSM action parameter the name of a datapoint
      to be converted at run time into it's actual value. By using :
	$dp = <dp_name>
      in <dp_name> the variables $domain and $obj can be used to allow for variable 
      datapoint names.
      In this case the user is not asked at run-time for the value of the parameter.
    - The Operational panels that allow the display of parameters have been made dynamic
      their size depends on the number of parameters.
    - Fixed the summary alarms for control units, they had stopped working properly
      since 24r14 when the "Take" etc. mechanism was changed.
    - Created the possibility of deciding wheather or not the FSM generates an handles
      summary alarms. The flag can be set in the "Advanced Settings" panel on the tree
      top node. A "Generate Tree" of the relevant trees should follow.
    - Created the functions fwUi_startEnDisableDevices() and fwUi_stopEnDisableDevices()
      to try to optimize Enabling/Disabling, "Take", etc.
      They can be used around a loop that changes enable/disable settings for many devices.
    - Fixed a bug that allowed users to send commands to shared but "free" CUs/objects
    - Logical View devices were wrongly displayed graphically as LUs instead of DUs.


19-02-2007 Release Notes for FwFsm v25r3
    - DIM v16r9
    - SMI++ v29r3
    - PVSS 3.6 (only)

Bug Fixes/Improvements:
    - When "Restarting FSMs" sometimes DUs did not restart properly - fixed.
    - Optimized the whole mechanist of start/restart FSMs:
	- Now the smiSM processes are stopped by PVSS00smi and not by the fwFsmSrvr script.
    - When restarting the project all FSMs should now die and report "DEAD".
    - Optimized the Enable/Disable Device/LU Operations:
	- Now the command is sent like any other command via a dpSet to PVSS00sim
          instead of being sent by the fwFsmSrvr script.
    - Fixed a bug when parsing the FSM code: Object types containing the strings:
	"if", "when", "do" and "set" were not generated properly.
    - In the FSM Operation panels the "Non visible" children were not accounted for
      properly, fixed.
    - Disallowed Operation States
	Added the function: 	
	    - fwFsmUi_setDisallowedOperationStates(dyn_string types, dyn_string states)
	To prevent the user to change operation mode (Include, Exclude, etc) when in a certain 
	set of states.
	For example an object of type: DAQ can not be Excluded while it is in state: RUNNING.  
    - Exclude Permanently
	A new command allowing to exclude a CU without propagating the orange square
    - Access Control: Fixed a bug when a new user logged in, now it checks if it still has 
      the right to manipulate the open panels, if yes, nothing happens, otherwise the tree(s)
      are released.
    - The "do" instruction wizard was not proposing the correct parameters for the selected
      instruction - fixed.
    - Some panel's widgets had wrong "tooltips" - fixed.

    - Corrected the PVSS 3.6 PVSS00smi startup script for Linux SLC4
    - Object Type Actions imported from file were by default "Not Visible" - fixed.
    - Added a "Configuration DB" menu item in the "Editor" mode for FSM Trees,
      it opens the FwFSMConfDB panel.
    - FSM nodes were sometimes added at the wrong level in the tree widget (at the same
      level as the system name, instead of inside it) - Fixed.
    - Added a "ToolTip" for FSM modes in the Operation panels
