In order to Build the DIM and/or SMI ApiManager and/or the FwUi library:
	PVSS00dim and/or PVSS00smi and/or FwUi.so

The following environment variables have to be set up:

  API_ROOT Set to the PVSS API installation directory
  PLATFORM linux
  DIMDIR   Set to the DIM installation directory
  SMIDIR   Set to the SMI++ installation directory (for SMI only)

Then do: 
	gmake VERSION="<version>" all	! to make everything
	or 
	gmake VERSION="<version>" dim	! to make only PVSS00dim

Where <version> is the PVSS version, it can be:
2.12
2.12.1
3.0
3.6

Finally copy the executables to the relevant project's bin directory:
	linux/PVSS00dim<version>
	linux/PVSS00smi<version>
	linux/FwUi<version>.so

NOTE:
The current executables for the latest PVSS versions are already in the "linux" directory
