      <p>This panel is used to set up the database login information for RDB Archiving, and which mode the database is in.</p>

<p>Before running the RDB Archive Manager for the first time, or if you want to change the database details, you should enter your database name, username, and password into this panel and then click the &quot;Set as Archive RDB&quot; button. This will set these values in the three places where PVSS looks for them. You should restart the RDB Archive Manager after changing the database details. If you reopen the panel, the database name and username will be filled out automatically, but not the password. You only need to type the password again if you need to change it, or if you want to view or change the database mode or mappings.</p>
<p>To check which mode the database is currently in, enter the database details and click &quot;Connect&quot;. Note that this only connects to the database for using this panel and <a href="fwRDBArchivingMappings.htm">fwRDBArchivingMappings.pnl</a>, it does not start archiving. If the connection could be opened, the panel will show &quot;Current Mode: Automatic&quot;, &quot;Current Mode: Custom&quot;, or &quot;Current Mode: Off&quot; and enable the buttons to switch modes. If the current mode is Off, it may mean that some features from Automatic mode and some features of Custom mode have been enabled.</p>
<p>The writeWithBulk mode should either be &quot;On&quot; or &quot;Off&quot;. These indicate that that the writeWithBulk setting in the configuration file agrees with the way the database is set up. It could also say &quot;On in database&quot; or &quot;Off in database&quot;, which means that the setup in the database does not match the setting in the configuration file. In this case you should use the 'Turn on' button to turn writeWithBulk on in both places. Otherwise, data could be written twice or not at all. You should always make sure that the RDB Archive Manager is not running when you change the writeWithBulk setting.
<p>To change the RDB Archiver settings such as buffer size, click the 'Settings...' button to open the standard PVSS setup panel for the RDB Archive Manager.
<p>If the database is in Custom mode, the &quot;Configure Mappings...&quot; button will be enabled. You can click on it to configure which tables the data is stored in, using <a href="fwRDBArchivingMappings.htm">fwRDBArchivingMappings.pnl</a>.
<p/>
<b>Opening the panel</b>
<p>This panel can either be opened directly, or by clicking the 'Parameterize...' button on the framework archiving setup panel, which sets <tt>$sDPE</tt> to the list of selected datapoint elements.</p>
<b>Datapoint Aliases</b>

<p>There is a table in the database called <tt>ALIASES</tt>, where changes to the aliases of archived datapoint elements are recorded. This is only automatically updated with changes to the actual elements which are archived. However, you may wish to record the aliases of the datapoints themselves, as these contain the names of devices in the FSM tree. These cannot be automatically recorded on the database side because PVSS only sends information about the specific elements being archived. If <tt>%sDPE</tt> is defined, then an 'Update Aliases Table' button will appear on this panel. If you click this then the aliases of the parent DPs of the DPEs you selected will be added to the database. If your database is in Automatic mode, you can also access this button from the <a href="fwRDBArchivingMappings.htm">fwRDBArchivingMappings.pnl</a></p>

<p>The button adds alias information for each datapoint when a mapping is added for one of its elements. If any of the aliases change, you can update the information in the database using the ‘Update Aliases table’ buttons. This updates the information for all datapoint elements which have mappings.</p>

<p>A new entry is only written to the <tt>ALIASES</tt> table when the alias has changed from the previous value in the table, or when the alias is not already in the table and is not blank.</p></td>
