The Makefile is used to asemble the complete createSchema.sql or updateSchema.sql
files, out of partial files and "template" files: .sql.IN and .SQL
The CPP preprocessor, and #include statements are used to achieve this.

After being generated, the .sql files should be copied to the parent (/config)
subdirectory
